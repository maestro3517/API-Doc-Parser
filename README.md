   pnpm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üîë API Key Security

This application prioritizes user privacy and security:
- API keys are stored only in the client's browser localStorage
- Keys are never transmitted to our servers
- Direct communication between client and OpenAI API

# Workflow Creator API

This project provides API endpoints for extracting API documentation from websites and converting them into structured workflow actions.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Process URLs (`/api/process-urls`)

Process one or more specific API documentation URLs.

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/process-urls
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com/api/docs",
    "https://another-example.com/api/reference"
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/docs",
      "status": "success",
      "result": "...",
      "parsedData": {
        "step_name": "Example API Action",
        "action": "example_action",
        "inputs": { ... },
        "prerequisites": { ... },
        "api_config": { ... },
        "response_schema": { ... }
      },
      "prerequisiteUrls": [ ... ],
      "prerequisiteWorkflows": [ ... ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Process Root URL (`/api/process-root-url`)

Process a root URL, automatically discover API documentation pages, and extract structured workflow actions from each.

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/process-root-url
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "rootUrl": "https://example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "rootUrl": "https://example.com",
  "apiEndpoints": [
    "https://example.com/api/docs",
    "https://example.com/api/reference"
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/docs",
      "status": "success",
      "result": {
        "step_name": "Example API Action",
        "action": "example_action",
        "inputs": { ... },
        "prerequisites": { ... },
        "api_config": { ... },
        "response_schema": { ... }
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/reference",
      "status": "success",
      "result": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "successCount": 2,
  "totalScanned": 2
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Root URL Processing:**
   - The system scrapes the provided root URL
   - It extracts links that might point to API documentation
   - Each potential API documentation URL is processed

2. **API Documentation Detection:**
   - The system uses keyword analysis to identify API documentation
   - Pages with sufficient API-related keywords are processed

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - API documentation is sent to an AI model (Gemini)
   - The AI extracts structured information about the API
   - Results are returned as workflow actions

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Google Gemini API key (for AI processing)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with your API keys:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000/api/`

# Workflow Creator

A tool for automatically extracting API workflows from documentation.

## API Processing Architecture

The API processing system is organized into stages:

### 1. Scraping the Root Page

This stage handles two types of scraping:
- Finding all API doc links on the root page
- When no API links are found on the root page, going one level deep on subsections

### 2. Processing the Scraped Data

After scraping, we have a list of API doc URLs to process:
- We use LLM (OpenAI or Gemini) to process each URL and extract API data
- We first detect if the doc URL contains only 1 API or multiple APIs
- For URLs with multiple APIs, we extract all APIs and return them in a structured format

### 3. Linking Prerequisites

After processing the data, we have a list of API data:
- We use LLM to link prerequisites present in the API data with other API data from the entire list
- When we find a relevant action for a prerequisite, we add that action to the API data
- This creates a connected graph of API actions

### 4. Final Result

After linking the prerequisites, we have a final list of API data that is returned to the client.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into modules:

```
src/
  utils/
    api-processing/
      index.ts                 # Main entry point
      stages/
        1-scraping.ts          # Stage 1: Scraping
        2-processing.ts        # Stage 2: Processing
        3-linking.ts           # Stage 3: Linking
  pages/
    api/
      process-root-url.ts      # API endpoint
```

## Usage

To process a root URL, make a POST request to the `/api/process-root-url` endpoint:

```json
{
  "rootUrl": "https://example.com/api-docs",
  "model": "openai"  // or "gemini"
}
```

The response will contain the extracted API data with linked prerequisites.
